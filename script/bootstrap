You need to install ruby 2.5.1

I'd strongly suggest to use 'chruby' or 'rbenv' to manage rubies and make your
development easier. I have a personal favor for 'chruby' so I'll explain that
one.

      1. Install 'chruby' as described here: https://github.com/postmodern/chruby
      2. Install 'ruby-install' https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install#readme
      3. ruby-install ruby 2.5.1
      4. In a new shell navigat to this folder and do 'chruby 2.5.1'
      5. 'ruby -v' should now output ruby-2.5.1

'rbenv' https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv has its own ruby installer etc, but chruby
does less and does it better.

Anyhoe, use the right ruby.

You need to install yarn

app/javascripts is used by rails/webpacker, which in turns depends on
yarn to install the dependencies, so rather than finding out later,
better install yarn now.

bundle exec ruby -e 'require "hesabu"; File.file?(Hesabu::HESABUCLI) ? exit(0) : exit(1)' >/dev/null 2>&1  || {
    cat <<HESABU
You don't seem to have a binary for the hesabu gem.

https://github.com/BLSQ/hesabu

The easiest way to fix this is to download a release for your platform at:

https://github.com/BLSQ/go-hesabu/releases

And install it at $(bundle exec ruby -e 'require "hesabu"; puts Hesabu::HESABUCLI')
HESABU
}
